# Auto Chess.com Game Review

A userscript that automatically iterates through game review pages from the game archive page.

# Installation

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension on your browser.
2. Click this link to install the script: https://github.com/NamuChon/auto-chesscom-game-review/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-review.user.js

# Usage

1. If you don't want the script to run immediately after entering game archive, disable it temporarily.
2. Go to your Chess.com game archive: https://www.chess.com/games/archive
3. (Optional) You can filter the games you want to review on the sidebar or skip pages. The script will not change the settings.
4. Enable the script.
5. Refresh the screen. The script will start entering game review pages.

# Notes

- This is not a free game review, you need a Chess.com membership for unlimited reviews.
- The script will not stop automatically until all archive pages are over. You can close the tab or go the Chess.com hompage then disable the script or Tampermonkey itself.
