# Auto Chess.com Game Review

A userscript that automatically reviews your games on Chess.com from the game archive page.

# Installation

1. Install the Tampermonkey extension on your browser: https://www.tampermonkey.net/
2. Enable the settings "Allow User Scripts" and "Developer mode". On Chrome, click the puzzle icon on the top -> click three dots on the Tampermonkey extension -> Manage Extension -> "Allow User Scripts" from the menu and "Developer mode" on top right.
3. Click this link to install the script: https://github.com/NamuChon/auto-chesscom-game-review/raw/refs/heads/main/auto-review.user.js

# Usage

1. If you don't want the script to run immediately after entering game archive, disable it temporarily.
2. Go to your Chess.com game archive: https://www.chess.com/games/archive
3. (Optional) You can use the "Game History" sidebar to filter games you want to review or skip pages to decide the starting point. The script will not change the settings.
4. Enable the script.
5. Refresh the screen. The script will start reviewing the games one by one. It will skip already reviewed ones.

# Notes

- This script does not bypass Chess.com restrictions, you still need a Chess.com membership for unlimited reviews.
- The script will not stop automatically until all archive pages are processed. You can close the tab or go the Chess.com hompage then disable the script or Tampermonkey itself.
